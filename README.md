This repository contains a Dockerfile that fails to build because the `requirements.txt` file is missing from the context.  The `Dockerfile.fixed` provides a corrected version that includes the file.

The original Dockerfile attempts to install Python dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but the file is not copied into the image before this command is executed, leading to a build error.

The solution involves copying the `requirements.txt` file into the image before installing the dependencies.
